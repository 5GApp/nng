While this is discouraged for long term use, as a transition aid
applications may use the value returned by the
<a href="nng_socket_id.3.html"><code>nng_socket_id()</code></a> in these functions just like a
socket descriptor (as if the socket were opened via
<a href="nn_socket.3compat.html"><code>nn_socket()</code></a>).
This sort of API intermixing should only be used during transition from
the legacy API to the new API.

<p>Protocols implement communication patterns, such as

protocol defines the key behavior of the socket.</p>

<p>Conversely, transports are the underlying mechansims by which messages
are moved between participants, such as TCP/IP or UNIX domain IPC.
A given <a href="nng_socket.5.html">socket</a> may be using several transports at the same
time.</p>
